RShuttle was thought of, designed, and implemented over BrickhackV. The idea originally came from
some of the team members use of RIT's Shuttle app as well as a 3rd party app that kept track of
shuttle routes for multiple colleges accross the country. Most of them used the third  party app,
but did not like the overall package, that was bulky due to its wider use case. This app was
smoother and better presented than RIT's app. We started by looking into how the third party app
was able to gather the data needed in order to function. One of the design challenges that we
was deciding the platform that we would use. We settled for android studio using java for the
functionality. The advantages that we saw in using android studio over the two other, React and
IOS, was due to the ease of use and avalability of compatable hardware respectivly. Our ultimate
focus  throughout the inception of the project was the end result achiving our initial goals.
